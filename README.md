### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a full-stack software developer with 7+ years of professional experience working in Agile software teams. Proficient at handling database, server, front-end web, and mobile app work to deliver complete products.

I have indie developed some very cool software products that have been used by hundreds of thousands of people. Here are some of them:

You can get to know me a little better by [reading some of my blog posts](https://dev.to/toureholder) and [SO contributions](https://stackoverflow.com/users/2551290/tour%c3%a9-holder) and you can get in touch via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tour%C3%A9-holder-63576a10b/) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/toureholder).

When I'm not doing anything related to programming or having fun with my wife and kid, my distractions include calisthenics, **trying** to sing, dance, do capoeira or play the guitar or piano.
