### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a full-stack software developer with 5+ years of professional experience working in Agile software teams. Proficient at handling database, server, front-end web, and mobile app work to deliver complete products. I have indie developed some very cool software products that have been used by hundreds of thousands of people.

When I'm not doing anything related to programming or having fun with my wife and kid, my distractions include calisthenics, and trying to sing, dance and play the guitar.
